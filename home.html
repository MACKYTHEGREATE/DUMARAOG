                    <h3 class="display-7">LANGUAGES</h3>
                    <p>There are two official languages in the Philippines—Filipino and English. Filipino which is based on Tagalog, is the national language. English is also widely used and is the medium of instruction in higher education. There are also eight (8) major languages spoken by majority of the Filipinos: Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Bicol, Waray, Kapampangan, and Pangasinense.
                        <br>
                        <br>Filipino is the native language which is used nationally as the language of communication among ethnic groups. Like any living language, Filipino is in a process of development through loans from Philippine languages and non-native languages for various situations, among speakers of different social backgrounds, and for topics for conversation and scholarly discourse.</p>

<br>
                        For up-to-date weather information, visit the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Adminstration (PAGASA)</p>
<hr>
                        <h3 class="display-7">CURRENCY</h3>
                        <p>The Philippine Peso (sign: ₱; code: PHP) is the official currency in the country. 100 centavos or sentimos make up 1 peso.
<br><br>
                            Foreign currency may be exchanged at your hotel, and in most of the large department stores, banks and authorized money changing shops. Exchanging money anywhere else is illegal and the laws are strictly enforced.
                            <br><br>
                            Most large stores, restaurants, hotels, and resorts accept major credit cards including American Express, Visas, and MasterCard. Traveler's Checks preferably American Express are accepted at hotels and large department stores. Personal checks drawn on foreign banks are generally not accepted.
                            <br><br>
                            The best currency to take when in the Philippines is the local peso.</p>
<hr>
                            <h3 class="display-7">UNIT OF MEASURE</h3>
                            <p>The Philippines generally uses the metric system in most trade and legal transactions. Inches, feet and yards (for textiles) are common in everyday use for measuring things.                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <h3 class="display-7">ELECTRICITY</h3>
                            <p>The supply voltage in the Philippines is 220 volts. 110 volts alternating current is also used especially in major hotels.
<br>
<br>
                                If the appliance is single voltage rated, it will need to operate on the same voltage as the supply voltage of the country e.g. 220 volts.</p>
                            
                            <hr>
                                <h3 class="display-7">WATER</h3>
                            <p>Water supply in Metro Manila and in all the other major cities are considered potable. Bottled purified water, spring water or mineral water is often supplied by hotels and resorts, and sold in all grocery stores.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h3 class="display-7">CLOTHING</h3>
                            <p>Since the Philippines is a tropical country, where temperature can get humid, it is advisable to wear light and loose clothing. White and light colors are perfect as they reflect the heat. Try your dark-colored tops at night for a more refreshing feeling. Having a basic classic white tee is also strongly recommended.
<br><br>
                                The men’s national costume is called a Barong Tagalog–a formal garment often made from thin fabric (piña or abaca) and is richly embroidered. It can be used by both men and women and it looks like a tunic or shirt with long sleeves and is worn over a usual shirt. If you must attend any occasion which would require a suit and a tie, the Barong Tagalog is a wonderful substitute, usually worn with a Chinese collarless shirt called camisa de chino.</p>
                            <hr>
                                <h3 class="display-7">BUSINESS HOURS</h3>
                            <p>Most businesses are open from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM from Monday to Friday and 8:00 AM until noon on Saturdays. Banks are open from 9:00 AM until 3:00 PM from Mondays through Fridays. When doing your bank transaction, it is advisable to have your passport with you for identification.
<br><br>
                                No employee in the Philippines must work for over 8 hours a day. An employee is worthy of a 1-hour lunch break daily, without fail. However, a worker is only required to work for a maximum of 8 hours per day from the office. There are no laws that mandate his working hours from home.
                          <br><br>      
                                Post offices are open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays only. Stamps for postcards are frequently available from the Concierge Desk at most major hotels. The Philippines uses ZIP codes, please include them in addressing local mail.
                                <br><br>
                                NOTE: The Standard lunch hour is from 12 noon to 1:00 PM.</p><hr>
                            <h3 class="display-7">TIME ZONE</h3>
